### League Commissioner ###

<br>

### Commissioner Site Powers ###
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams.
<br>
### Co-Commissioner Appointment ###
The Commissioner can nominate up to two Co-Commissioners who will then require a majority vote by the rest of the league to be appointed.
<br>
### Dispute Arbitration ###
The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie the commissioner will always have the tiebreaking vote. When an issue arrises where a clear conflict of interest is apparant the matter will be handled by the co-commissioners. If they disagree on what action should be taken the matter will be put to a league vote (the vote will exclude anyone with a conflict of interest).
<br>
### Rule Changes ###
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive a majority (in a tie the commissioner has the tiebreaking vote), the commissioner has the option to veto a rule change in which case it can be voted on again and receive a 2/3 majority to pass without commissioner consent.
<br>
### Collusion ###
**Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will be vetoed if there is evident collusion and the guilty teams will be removed from the league and forfeit any dues paid**
